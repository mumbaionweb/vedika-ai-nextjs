# ✅ WebSocket Disconnection Fix

## Problem
WebSocket was closing immediately after receiving `stream_start` event, before chunks could arrive.

## Root Cause
1. React Strict Mode causing double renders in development
2. useEffect dependencies causing re-renders
3. Missing handling for `conversation_started` event
4. WebSocket closing too early

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Prevent Double Connection (React Strict Mode)
```typescript
const isConnectingRef = useRef(false);

if (isConnectingRef.current) {
  console.log('⚠️ Already connecting, skipping...');
  return;
}
isConnectingRef.current = true;
```

### 2. Remove Unstable Dependencies
```typescript
// Before: }, [conversationId, streamingMessageId]);
// After:
}, [conversationId]); // Only stable dependency
```

### 3. Add Connection Handlers
```typescript
onConnectionOpen: () => {
  console.log('✅ WebSocket connection opened');
  setIsConnected(true);
}
```

### 4. Close After Stream Complete
```typescript
onStreamComplete: (event) => {
  // ... mark complete ...
  
  // ✅ Close AFTER stream is done
  setTimeout(() => {
    wsServiceRef.current.disconnect();
  }, 1000);
}
```

### 5. Better Cleanup
```typescript
return () => {
  console.log('🧹 Cleanup: Disconnecting WebSocket');
  wsService.disconnect();
  isConnectingRef.current = false;
};
```

## Result
✅ WebSocket stays connected through entire stream
✅ Receives all content_chunk events
✅ Only closes after stream_complete
✅ No premature disconnections

## Testing
1. Submit a message from homepage
2. Navigate to chat page
3. Watch console logs:
   - ✅ WebSocket connected
   - ✅ Stream started
   - ✅ Chunks received (many times)
   - ✅ Stream complete
   - ✅ WebSocket closed
