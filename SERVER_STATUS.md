# Server Status - All Issues Resolved ✅

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Status:** Server running successfully  
**URL:** http://localhost:3000

---

## Problem Summary

Multiple internal server errors (500) were occurring when accessing `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Root Cause Analysis

The internal server errors were caused by:

1. **Corrupted `.next` cache** - Build manifest files were missing or corrupted
2. **Multiple conflicting Next.js processes** - Several dev servers were running simultaneously on different ports
3. **Stale port 3000 process** - Old process was holding onto port 3000 even after restarts

## Resolution Steps

1. **Killed all Next.js processes:**
   ```bash
   pkill -9 -f "next dev"
   pkill -9 -f "next-server"
   ```

2. **Cleared all caches:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next .turbo
   ```

3. **Started fresh dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev > /tmp/dev_clean.log 2>&1 &
   ```

## Current Status

✅ **Server is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000**  
✅ **No compilation errors**  
✅ **No runtime errors**  
✅ **All features working correctly:**
   - Model selection dropdown with "Best" default
   - Sources (Web, Attach) buttons
   - Interaction Modes (Type, Dictation, Voice)
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Vedika Coins display (20 coins)

## Prevention

To avoid future internal server errors:

1. **Always use `npm run dev:clean` instead of `npm run dev`:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:clean
   ```
   This script automatically kills old processes, clears caches, and starts fresh.

2. **If you see "Port 3000 is in use":**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   rm -rf .next .turbo
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Monitor logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/dev_clean.log
   ```

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Clean restart (recommended)
npm run dev:clean

# Manual clean restart
pkill -f "next dev" && rm -rf .next .turbo && npm run dev

# Check if server is running
curl -I http://localhost:3000

# View server logs
tail -f /tmp/dev_clean.log
```

## Next Steps

The server is now stable and ready for:
- Model selection API integration
- Backend API connectivity
- User testing
- Feature development
