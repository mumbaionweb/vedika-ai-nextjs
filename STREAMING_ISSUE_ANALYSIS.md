# Streaming Issue - Complete Analysis

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Issue**: AI responses not streaming to chat page, loader keeps loading indefinitely  
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Backend Not Streaming

---

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### **Backend is NOT sending stream messages**

**Evidence from Console Logs**:
```
✅ conversation_started received at 01:20:27.186Z
❌ NO stream_start message
❌ NO stream_chunk messages  
❌ NO stream_complete message
```

**What IS Working**:
- ✅ Session creation and validation
- ✅ WebSocket connection (after reconnect)
- ✅ Message sending from homepage
- ✅ `conversation_started` event received
- ✅ Navigation to chat page
- ✅ Streaming listener setup (3 times due to React Strict Mode)

**What is NOT Working**:
- ❌ Backend not sending `stream_start`
- ❌ Backend not sending `stream_chunk`
- ❌ Backend not sending `stream_complete`
- ❌ Result: Frontend waits forever with loading spinner

---

## 📊 Message Flow Analysis

### **Expected Flow**:
```
1. Homepage sends: {routeKey: 'stream_chat', message: '...', ...}
2. Backend responds: {type: 'conversation_started', conversation_id: '...'}
3. Backend streams: {type: 'stream_start'}
4. Backend streams: {type: 'stream_chunk', content: '...'}
5. Backend streams: {type: 'stream_chunk', content: '...'}
6. Backend streams: {type: 'stream_complete'}
```

### **Actual Flow**:
```
1. Homepage sends: {routeKey: 'stream_chat', message: '...', ...} ✅
2. Backend responds: {type: 'conversation_started', conversation_id: '...'} ✅
3. [STOPS HERE - NO MORE MESSAGES] ❌
```

## 🔍 Frontend Debugging Added

### **Homepage (app/page.tsx)**:
- ✅ Message sending with full payload logging
- ✅ Conversation started event tracking
- ✅ Navigation flow logging

### **Chat Page (app/chat/[chatId]/page.tsx)**:
- ✅ useEffect trigger tracking
- ✅ Streaming listener setup (with timestamps)
- ✅ React Strict Mode cleanup tracking
- ✅ hasSetupStreamingRef state tracking
- ✅ Full message handling with JSON dumps

### **WebSocket Context (contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx)**:
- ✅ RAW message logging for ALL messages
- ✅ Full JSON dump of message data
- ✅ Active listener count
- ✅ Handler notification tracking
- ✅ Connection state tracking

## 🐛 Secondary Issue: React Strict Mode

### **Issue**:
React Strict Mode tears down and re-creates the WebSocket context multiple times, causing:
- WebSocket disconnects and reconnects
- Listener setup/teardown cycles
- Potential message loss during reconnection

### **Solution Applied**:
- Reset `hasSetupStreamingRef` to `false` in cleanup
- Allow React Strict Mode's second run to set up listener again
- Keep sessionStorage for 100ms to survive React Strict Mode

### **Result**:
- Listener is now set up correctly on second run
- No more "Skipping - condition not met" messages
- **BUT** still no stream messages from backend

## 🔧 Backend Investigation Needed

### **Questions for Backend Team**:

1. **Is the streaming implemented?**
   - Does the backend actually stream responses?
   - Or does it only send `conversation_started`?

2. **What triggers streaming?**
   - Is `routeKey: 'stream_chat'` correct?
   - Are additional parameters required?
   - Is there a separate endpoint/route for streaming?

3. **Authentication/Session**:
   - Is the session valid for streaming?
   - Are there permission checks that might block streaming?

4. **WebSocket connection**:
   - Is the backend aware of the client's WebSocket connection?
   - Does it know where to send stream messages?
   - Is there a connection ID or routing key needed?

5. **Message format**:
   - Is the request payload correct?
   - Are all required fields present?
   - Is the format what the backend expects?

### **Request Payload Sent**:
```json
{
  "routeKey": "stream_chat",
  "message": "What is your name?",
  "device_id": "device_q0sxry4eoqc_1760895516153",
  "session_id": "e0beb0bd-4788-4f33-be9e-308ffa6df16b",
  "request_type": "anonymous",
  "model_id": "best",
  "query_type": "general"
}
```

### **Response Received**:
```json
{
  "type": "conversation_started",
  "conversation_id": "8ee8c33a-e9a2-4ff1-ade8-11e658262ac7",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T01:20:27.148010"
}
```

### **Expected BUT NOT Received**:
```json
{
  "type": "stream_start",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
{
  "type": "stream_chunk",
  "content": "I am ",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
{
  "type": "stream_chunk",
  "content": "Vedika AI",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
{
  "type": "stream_complete",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions**:

1. **Backend Log Check**:
   - Check backend logs for this conversation ID: `8ee8c33a-e9a2-4ff1-ade8-11e658262ac7`
   - Look for streaming initialization
   - Check for errors or exceptions

2. **Backend Code Review**:
   - Verify streaming is implemented for `stream_chat` route
   - Check if there are conditions that prevent streaming
   - Verify WebSocket message sending logic

3. **Test with Backend Directly**:
   - Use a WebSocket client tool (e.g., Postman, wscat)
   - Connect to: `wss://wa33d8dcw2.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
   - Send the same payload
   - Observe if stream messages are received

4. **Alternative Test**:
   - Try a different query type or model
   - Try an authenticated request (if possible)
   - Check if streaming works for specific scenarios only

## 💡 Temporary Workarounds

Until streaming is fixed, consider:

1. **Polling**:
   - After `conversation_started`, poll the conversation endpoint
   - Fetch messages every 2-3 seconds
   - Display new messages as they appear

2. **Fallback to REST**:
   - Don't rely on streaming
   - Use regular HTTP requests for messages
   - Display results when complete

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Show "AI is thinking..." message
   - Add a progress indicator
   - Provide context that response is being generated

## ✅ Conclusion

**Frontend**: Working correctly with comprehensive debugging  
**Backend**: NOT sending stream messages after `conversation_started`  
**Action Required**: Backend team needs to investigate why streaming is not working  
**Priority**: HIGH - This is a critical user-facing issue
