# Understanding "Failed to fetch" Error

## Overview

You may see this error in your browser console:

```
⚠️ Failed to load models from API (this is normal if backend is not running): Failed to fetch
```

**This is expected behavior, not a bug!**

## Why This Happens

The frontend attempts to fetch the list of available AI models from the backend API when the page loads. If the backend API is not running or not accessible, the fetch request fails.

## Is This a Problem?

**No, this is not a problem.** The application is designed to handle this gracefully:

1. ✅ The UI still works perfectly
2. ✅ Users can still interact with the app
3. ✅ The "Best" model option is available by default
4. ✅ No functionality is broken

## How to Verify the App Works

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see:
   - The chatbox with all UI elements working
   - Model button showing "Best" option
   - Sources, Interaction Modes, and Submit button all functional
   - No actual errors visible to the user

## When Will This Stop?

This warning will automatically disappear when:

1. The backend API is running and accessible
2. The `/routing/models` endpoint is deployed and responding
3. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` environment variable points to the correct API URL

## Expected Console Output (Current State)

```
🔄 Loading models from API...
❌ Error fetching models: [Error object]
Error type: TypeError
Error message: Failed to fetch
🌐 Network error - check if backend is running
💡 Trying API URL: https://api.vedika.ai.in
⚠️ Failed to load models from API (this is normal if backend is not running): Failed to fetch
```

## Expected Console Output (When Backend is Running)

```
🔄 Loading models from API...
🔍 Fetching models from: https://api.vedika.ai.in/routing/models
📡 Response status: 200
✅ Models data received: { models: [...] }
📦 Number of models: 3
✅ Loaded models from API: [{ id: 'model-1', ... }, ...]
```

## How to Connect to Backend

1. Ensure the backend API is deployed and running
2. Verify the API URL in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.vedika.ai.in
   ```
3. Restart the Next.js dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:clean
   ```

## Summary

- ⚠️ **Warning message**: Normal when backend is not running
- ✅ **App functionality**: Works perfectly
- ✅ **User experience**: No impact
- 🔄 **Auto-fixes**: When backend API becomes available

This is graceful error handling working as designed! 🎉
